# Convolution

## Building

```shell
cargo xtask bundle convolution_plug --release
```

Note to self:
`Get-Content  "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Bitwig Studio\engine.log" -wait`

### Plans for next iteration

- use (fundsp) Net for DSP
- be able to apply envelope to IRs
- add visual EQ controls (spline type thing)
- support stereo IRs as well as multiple formats
- general optimizations
